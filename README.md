# Gard22_Weather_Dash

This is a Weather Dash board created by me using the openweatherAPI.
This is dashboard was given to me in week 6 of my bootcamp. The Code for this project was created using bootstrap and the openweatherapi. I created the javascript code in order to allow users to request the weather for any city by simply inserting the city and state into the search bar.

#Description

The current assignment was to work with the openweatherapi and geo locater api and use fetch calls to get back promises that we could use to dynamically display information that the user requests. I worked with Bootstrap and DayJS and Javascript in order to provide the functionality for this project. I added code to display the time, as well as dynamically create card to display the current and future weather. I also used local storage to save and persist data.
